# SPRINT 2.1 - BASIC JAVASCRIPT EXERCISES

This repository contains the basic JavaScript exercises for Sprint 2.1. It is organized into branches to keep the project clean and structured:

- **Main branch**: `main`  
- **Sub-branch**: `developer` (derived from `main`)  
- **Exercise branches**: from `exercici1.1` to `exercici1.7` (all derived from `developer`)

Each `exercici1.X` branch includes:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `main.js` (which contains both the instructions and the solutions to the exercises)

The goal of this project is to review JavaScript fundamentals and practice writing functions to be applied in future exercises.

ðŸ”Ž **To check and/or debug the exercises:**  
Open the `index.html` file in the browser and open the developer console with `F12` (Windows) or `Cmd + Option + J` (Mac).
